# Folders Hash
A tool that calculates the SHA256 hash value for system folders.

# How to use

Open app

Click the 'Add' button to select folders, and their paths and hash values will be displayed in the table. You can modify or delete items directly from the table. The table also provides a count of the files.
Additionally, the 'Last Update' information indicates the most recent time the hash was changed.

⚠️ Please be aware of folder permissions; if you lack the necessary permissions, the app won't be able to calculate the hash value.

Recalculate: to reevaluate the hash values for all items.

Save: to store the paths, eliminating the need to re-add them to the table.

Capture Screen: the app's screen by pressing the "Capture Screen" button, with the image automatically copied to the clipboard.
